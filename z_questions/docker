what is the diffrerence between node22 and alpine other than being light weight

docker works on linus based so not .exe but .out only



2. 🔁 Rebuild and Restart Docker Container
Run the following commands from your project root:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker stop compiler-backend
docker rm compiler-backend
docker build -t oj-compiler-backend .
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env --name compiler-backend oj-compiler-backend
⚠️ This is necessary because Docker only loads .env when the container is created — not just started.

we have to specifically pass the env file to the docker for it to work properly during the run time
