my main backend is only making api call 
I have a doubt though sir
let say 
1. Compiler hosted on aws - no domain name - no ssl certificate
2.Main Backend + frontend hosted on render - ssl yes -https yes

so even when my frontend is not making direct api call and my main backend is making the api call to cpompiler backend it should create the https-http confict?



That’s a great question — and here’s the clear answer:

✅ No, it will NOT create an HTTPS-HTTP conflict if your frontend talks only to your main backend over HTTPS, and your main backend (on Render) calls your compiler backend (on AWS EC2) over HTTP.

Why?
Browser mixed content policy only applies to client-side requests (i.e., frontend JavaScript making HTTP calls from an HTTPS page).

If your main backend server (Render) is the one calling HTTP://3.111.x.x:PORT, then it’s a server-to-server request, and no mixed content warning/error will occur.

In short:
✅ Frontend → HTTPS → Main Backend ✅

✅ Main Backend → HTTP → Compiler Backend ✅

❌ Frontend → HTTP → Compiler Backend ❌ (This would trigger mixed content errors)

If you later decide to expose the compiler backend directly to frontend (e.g., WebSocket, real-time code output, etc.), then yes, you’ll need to secure it (HTTPS + domain) to avoid browser errors.

Let me know if you’re planning that kind of flow — we can adjust accordingly.
