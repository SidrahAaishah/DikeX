here are the steps i think i have to do correct me or add if anything else needed
1. login to my instance 
2.cd keys
3.chmod 400 "compiler-backend.pem"
4.ssh -i "compiler-backend.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-111-33-11.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
5.yes
the after login
install node.js and dependencies
1. sudo apt update
2.sudo apt install nodejs npm
then upload  my backend project
1.tell me the use of scp to tranfer from my local machine the backend folder is in realoj/Backend
2.cd backend 
3. npm install

set environment variables
1. touch .env
2nano .env and then copy paste my actual env to this

run the non dockerized backjedn
nodemon index.js
or use pm2

npm install -g pm2
pm2 start index.js
pm2 save
pm2 startup

and then 
llow port 5000 in EC2 security group
Go to EC2 ‚Üí Security Groups ‚Üí Inbound Rules

Add a new rule:

Type: Custom TCP

Port Range: 5000

Source: 0.0.0.0/0 (or restrict to your IP for security)

and then test


but with my dockerized compiler backedn this worked correctly

Great observation ‚Äî here's why your Dockerized compiler backend worked with just localhost, but your main backend on EC2 needs 0.0.0.0:

üê≥ In Docker:
When you write:

js
Copy
Edit
.listen(process.env.PORT)
it binds to localhost inside the container. Docker then maps that to a host port via -p (like -p 5000:5000). So:

The container‚Äôs localhost is exposed to your machine (or EC2) using Docker‚Äôs networking.

This works fine because Docker handles the port mapping for you.

üíª On EC2 (Non-Docker App):
You're running Node.js directly on the EC2 host, so:

localhost binds the server only to the internal interface.

External users (like you on your browser) hitting EC2's public IP won‚Äôt be able to connect ‚Äî because the app isn‚Äôt listening on that interface.

‚úÖ Solution:
For non-Docker apps on EC2, always bind to '0.0.0.0':

js
Copy
Edit
.listen(process.env.PORT, '0.0.0.0')
This makes your app accessible both:

from the EC2 instance itself (localhost)

and from the internet via its public IP

Let me know if you'd like me to check your exact index.js or Dockerfile for clarity.
