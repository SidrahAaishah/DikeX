during the logout funcyion i implemented
should i not call api to remove the token?

Excellent question. Here's the short answer:

‚úÖ You should call an API to remove the token only if:
Your backend uses server-side session/token management, e.g., storing tokens in a database or Redis

Or you're using refresh tokens, and want to revoke them

‚ùå You don't need to call a logout API if:
You're using stateless JWT authentication, where:

The token is stored only in localStorage or cookies

And the server does not track tokens

In that case, logging out is just:

Removing the token from the browser (localStorage.removeItem("token"))

Resetting Redux (dispatch(logout()))

Redirecting to /login

üîê If You're Using Refresh Tokens
You should:

Call a POST /logout API to invalidate the refresh token on the server

Then delete both access + refresh tokens from storage

Reset the app state

TL;DR Decision Tree
Backend Token Storage	Call Logout API?
‚ùå Stateless JWT	No
‚úÖ Refresh Tokens	Yes
‚úÖ Server-stored JWT	Yes
‚úÖ Sessions	Yes

Let me know what your backend uses ‚Äî I can help you implemen
