axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It allows your frontend (React, Vue, plain JS, etc.) to communicate with backend servers/APIs over the internet using HTTP methods like:

GET – fetch data

POST – send data

PUT/PATCH – update data

DELETE – remove data

// what is the difference between the path /api/profile and /profile
Adding /api to a route is just a naming convention — it doesn’t do anything special on its own, but it helps to:
. Separate frontend routes from backend (API) routes
Example:

/login → could serve your React frontend (e.g., a login page)

/api/login → serves your API (i.e., returns JSON, not HTML)

This way:

https://yourapp.com/login = browser route for user

https://yourapp.com/api/login = backend endpoint for axios/postma
