in simple words tell me the flow of what it does when a user submits the credentials in login
page in login.jsx in pages folder?

1.User submits login form in your React frontend: 
axios.post(`${VITE_API_URL}/login`, { email, password });

2.Frontend sends the login data to the backend (/login route).
3.The request first hits index.js: 
app.use('/', userRoutes); => this lines send the request to your router file (usrRoutes.js)

4.In userRoutes.js, you’ve written: router.post('/login', loginUser);
This means: "If someone hits /login, call the loginUser function." loginUser function is in controller

5.Now it calls the Controller: 
const loginUser = async (req, res) => { ... }the controller handles:
Checking if user exists
Verifying password
Sending back a token

6.If login is successful:
The controller sends a response with:
js
Copy
Edit
res.status(200).json({ user, token });

7.The frontend again the serviceAuthreceives the response, stores the token (in localStorage or cookies), and redirects the user.

8. after receiving the response it send the route to app.jsx where it handles what page to navigate and then it hits the main.jsx which at last renders the page

//  What is the Role of authServices.jsx (or .js) in Frontend (React)?
In simple words:

authServices.js is a helper file in your frontend that keeps all the API calling functions related to authentication (like login, signup, logout) in one place.

 if i want to use data from the login to send it to userAuth so it can send to index.js 
i should use ref or usestate?>

Why useState instead of useRef?
useState	useRef
✅ React re-renders when data changes	  ❌ React does NOT re-render when ref changes
Used for dynamic data flow between components	Used for persisting values across renders                                  without triggering updates
Perfect for forms, login inputs, auth states	Best for DOM refs or timers
