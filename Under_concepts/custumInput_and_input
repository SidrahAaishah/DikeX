what is the difference between customInput and input
🔁 customInput vs input
Term	Context	Meaning
customInput	Frontend (React)	The variable storing the value typed by the user in the input box
input	Backend (Node.js)	The key expected in the request body (i.e., req.body.input)

Why They’re Different:
On the frontend, you name your state variable anything (customInput here).

On the backend, the property name in the JSON payload must match the key you're accessing (like input).
