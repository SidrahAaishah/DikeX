When you login, your backend usually sends back a JWT (JSON Web Token) â€” a compact string that contains:

User identity info (like name, email, etc.)

Expiry timestamp

A signature (so the server can verify it's not been tampered with)

This is what gets saved in localStorage like:

localStorage.setItem('token', res.data.token);
