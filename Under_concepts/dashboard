ur Goal: Show Logged-in Name on Dashboard
You have two options:

✅ Option 1: Decode token locally (frontend)
If your token is a JWT, you can decode it (without verifying the signature) to get info like name or email

import jwtDecode from 'jwt-decode';

const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
const decoded = jwtDecode(token);
console.log(decoded.name); // if the backend included `name` in the payload

✅ Pros: No extra API call.
⚠️ Cons: Don't trust sensitive info fully — it's just base64 encoded.

✅ Option 2: Fetch user profile from backend
Use the token to make a request like:


const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
const res = await axios.get('/api/me', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});
console.log(res.data.name);
✅ Pros: Always secure & up-to-date
⚠️ Cons: Extra API call
